                    The sensor-based push-up and sit-up counter system is designed to accurately count and analyze physical movements during workouts. This system utilizes sensors attached to the user's body and sends data to a central server for real-time feedback and tracking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system includes two main parts: the client-side devices attached to the user (for push-ups and sit-ups) and a server that receives and processes the data. The sensors used are MPU-based, which detect orientation and movement, while the communication is handled using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The primary objective of the system is to help users track their workout performance accurately, ensuring that each exercise is performed correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The system also provides feedback to the user regarding their posture and execution, promoting proper form and reducing the risk of injury.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data collected from the sensors is stored and can be reviewed for progress tracking and statistical analysis.

                <p>This project is designed for internal use only and should only be edited by registered contributors. Please ensure the following key points are adhered to when using and modifying the system:</p>
    
                <h3>BLE Configuration</h3>
                <p>The system connects to an ESP32 device using the MAC address:</p>
                <code>34:B7:DA:F8:88:FA</code>
                <p>You can change it according to your ESP32's address.</p>
                
                <p>The project relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication. Make sure that your ESP32 is configured correctly and that the UUIDs for the BLE characteristics match between the ESP32 device and the code.</p>
                <code>UUID: your-uuid-here</code>
                
                <h3>Installation Requirements</h3>
                <p>Ensure that the <code>bleak</code> library is installed for BLE functionality:</p>
                <code>pip install bleak</code>
                <p>If you encounter any issues with the installation of bleak, use the following command:</p>
                <code>pip install https://github.com/hbldh/bleak/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip</code>
                
                <h3>Device Configuration</h3>
                <p>Before running the project, double-check that your BLE device is properly configured. Improper configurations may cause connection issues or unreliable performance.</p>
